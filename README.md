# react-native-clwy-video-player

A customisable, updated, React Native video player for Android and IOS, based on [abbasfreestyle react-native-af-video-player](https://github.com/abbasfreestyle/react-native-af-video-player) and 
[rbcorrea/react-native-rb-video-player](https://github.com/rbcorrea/react-native-rb-video-player).

This is a result of not merged pull requests and some modifications planned to be used with React Native 0.6+ version.

## What did I do?
- Android 

It works good on Android. I resolved all warning and FullScreenControl disappear errors.

- iOS

In iOSï¼ŒI recommend you to use [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) instead.

## Features

* Fullscreen support for Android and iOS!
* Works with react-navigation
* Optional action button for custom use
* Add your own logo and/or placeholder
* Customise theme

## Install

```shell
yarn add react-native-clwy-video-player react-native-orientation @sayem314/react-native-keep-awake

# Issues

Avoid adding alignItems: 'center' to the container, it can cause fullscreen mode to disappear :D

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'
import Video from 'react-native-clwy-video-player'

function VideoScreen({ route, navigation }) {  
  const [fullscreen, setFullscreen] = React.useState(false)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    navigation.setOptions({ headerShown: !fullscreen })
  }, [fullscreen, navigation])
  
  const logo = 'logo.png'
  const image = 'image.png'
  const source = '1.mp4'   

  return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
        <Video
            url={source}
            autoPlay
            logo={logo}
            placeholder={image}
            hideFullScreenControl={false}
            onFullScreen={status => onFullScreen(status)}
            rotateToFullScreen
        />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})

export default VideoScreen
```
